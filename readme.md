# My-codes
Hi there,
My-codes is a repo where I share some of my beginner Python projects.
I’m a 16-year-old from Morocco who’s really into programming and building automated systems.
I’m still learning, but I’ve been putting in a lot of effort — I’d really appreciate it if you checked out my projects.
